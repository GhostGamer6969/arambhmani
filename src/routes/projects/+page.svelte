  <h2>404: data not found, but we're working on it... 🤖</h2>
  <p>
    please remain calm while we perform a dns sacrifice to appease the backend
    gods 🙏.<br />
    our servers are probably stuck in an infinite loop, trying to escape the clutches
    of <code>undefined</code>.<br />
    don't worry, though — we're running a full system reboot, right after this cup
    of coffee ☕️.
  </p>
  <p>
    eta: as soon as we figure out how to break free from this deadlock.
    meanwhile, we're handling all your requests with 99.9% uptime — the 0.1% is
    just us finding a way out of a try-catch block.
  </p>
  <p>coming soon... (or whenever we stop debugging the debugger 🐛)</p>
